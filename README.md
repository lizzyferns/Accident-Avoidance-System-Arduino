# Accident Avoidance System using Arduino Uno

### Project Overview
Developed a sensor-integrated embedded safety system using **Arduino UNO** to enhance vehicle safety. The system provides real-time monitoring to prevent accidents by detecting environmental hazards and driver impairment.

### Key Features
* **Alcohol Detection:** Uses an **MQ3** sensor to monitor breath alcohol levels and prevent ignition.
* **Obstacle Detection:** Integrates an **HC-SR04** ultrasonic sensor to detect objects in the vehicle's path.
* **Accident/Tilt Sensing:** Employs an **ADXL345** accelerometer to detect vehicle tilt or sudden impacts.
* **Fire & Smoke Safety:** Utilizes **MQ2** and **SW420** sensors to detect smoke and excessive vibrations.

### Tech Stack
* **Microcontroller:** Arduino UNO.
* **Sensors:** ADXL345, SW420, MQ2, MQ3, HC-SR04.
* **Actuators:** L298N Motor Driver, DC Motors.
* **Software:** Arduino IDE.
